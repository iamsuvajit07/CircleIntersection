Problem Statement
Objective:
To create a web page that allows users to click and generate circles at the clicked locations. Each circle will have a random radius, and the code will check if any two generated circles intersect.

Functional Requirements:

Circle Generation:

On each click, a new circle is generated at the click location with a random radius between 50 and 200 pixels.
The circles are visually represented on the web page.
Circle Intersections:

The code will check if two circles intersect when there are exactly two circles on the page.
Intersection is determined based on the distance between the centers of the two circles being less than or equal to the sum of their radii.
Reset Mechanism:

If there are already two circles on the page, they are removed before adding a new circle.
This ensures that at most two circles are displayed and checked for intersection at any time.
Logging Intersection:

The intersection status (true/false) is logged to the console each time two circles are present and checked for intersection.
Code Explanation
The provided JavaScript code achieves this with the following key steps:

Data Storage:

Uses an array circleCoordinate to store the coordinates and radii of the circles.
Intersection Check:

Defines a function circleIntersect to calculate if two circles intersect based on their centers and radii.
Intersection Logging:

Defines a function logIfIntersectingCircle to extract circle data and check for intersection using circleIntersect.
Event Listener for Clicks:

Listens for click events on the document.
Removes existing circles if two are already present.
Generates new circles at the click location with random radii.
Adds the new circle's data to circleCoordinate and the circle element to the DOM.
Checks for intersection if there are two circles, logging the result to the console.
By following these steps, the code provides a dynamic way to visually create circles and determine their intersection on a web page.
